    <h2>ConnectR is the space for you to meet and connect with other students with similar interests!</h2>
    <p>Our objective is to not only connect students with other students, but for university student mentors to look at student profiles too! These mentors reach out to them and offer advice on university life. </p>
    <h2>How does our program work?</h2>
    <p>A student simply has to input their information in the search bar below and it will create a profile card for them. Afterwards, it will be posted, more like a listing/posting board. As other students explore the profile cards, they may find someone interesting and choose to contact them. It is a simple process, but has the potential to make a big change.</p>
    <h3>CONNECT WITH OTHERS NOW!</h3>
    <p>Leave your name, contact info, and your interests so that other students can contact you!</p>
    
    <input value="Name,Contact,Interests" id="getName"></input>
